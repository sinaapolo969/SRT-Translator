# SRT-Translator
i implement this simple code to translate the .srt files to any language!

## How to work!
you can just simply open your .srt file with notepad++ and copy all of it content and paste it into an excel file!
then copy and paste your file path in code and enjoy! it will return you a file with name 'subtittle.srt'!

also you can change your destination language!
just change the words between cotation here (dest = 'fa')

But unfortunately, this process may take a lot of time for long files!
